We developed a wiki with resources for the aspiring SGPLOT-ist. The hope is that the wiki contains enough material to guide you through the process of producing a figure without too much hand-holding. Of course you are going to have questions. But the hope is they won't be questions like, "How do I make a scatter plot?" 

This project was conceived of and executed as a wiki because we suspected that we were not going to get it perfect the first time.  We welcome feedback via GitHub or by contacting our team at graphics@rhoworld.com.
