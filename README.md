In my mind there are 4 primary ways to produce ODS Graphic output: the Graphics Template Language (GTL), statistical procedures, the SG Designer, and SG procedures.
- GTL is the basis for all ODS Graphics output. Though you might not use GTL directly to produce your output, rest assured it is lurking just under the covers. 
- The graphics produced by statistical procedures, while attractive, are rarely customizable enough to be suitable for commercial deliveries. 
- The SG Designer is a straightforward point-and-click interface for producing ODS Graphics output. Though the functionality is still somewhat limited. Moreover, the programs produced by the GUI are written in GTL.
- The technology that provides the right balance between ease of use and customizability is the family of SG procedures, and in particular SGPLOT.
