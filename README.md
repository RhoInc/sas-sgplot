The ODS Graphics technology that provides *the right balance between ease of use and customizability* is the family of SG procedures, and in particular SGPLOT. Indeed, we are so enamored with SGPLOT that we have created a wiki.

* The Home page contains a high-level overview of the SGPLOT procedure. 
* The Examples pages each take an individual figure and break it down into bite-sized morsels.  
  * Succinct programs are also provided if you only want the code and not the explanation. 
* The Etcetera pages cover various topics that apply broadly to figure production. 

The hope is that the wiki contains enough material to guide you through the process of producing a figure without too much hand holding. Of course you are going to have questions. But the hope is they won't be questions like, "How do I make a scatter plot?"
